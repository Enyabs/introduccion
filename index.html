<p>If you, if you could return
Don't let it burn<br>
Don't let it fade<br>

<p>I'm sure I'm not being rude
But it's just your attitude<br>
It's tearing me apart<br>
It's ruining every day<br>

<p>I swore, I swore I would be true
And honey so did you<br>
So why were you holding her hand?<br>
Is that the way we stand?<br>
Were you lying all the time?<br>
Was it just a game to you?<br>

<p>But I'm in so deep
You know I'm such a fool for you<br>
You got me wrapped around your finger<br>
Do you have to let it linger?<br>
Do you have to, do you have to, do you have to let it linger?<br>

<p>Oh, I thought the world of you
I thought nothing could go wrong<br>
But I was wrong, I was wrong<br>

<p>If you, if you could get by
Trying not to lie<br>
Things wouldn't be so confused<br>
And I wouldn't feel so used<br>
But you always really knew<br>
I just want to be with you<br>

<p>And I'm in so deep
You know I'm such a fool for you<br>
You got me wrapped around your finger<br>
Do you have to let it linger?<br>
Do you have to, do you have to, do you have to let it linger?<br>
And I'm in so deep<br>
You know I'm such a fool for you<br>
You got me wrapped around your finger<br>
Do you have to let it linger?<br>
Do you have to, do you have to, do you have to let it linger?<br>
You know I'm such a fool for you<br>
You got me wrapped around your finger<br>
Do you have to let it linger?<br>
Do you have to, do you have to, do you have to let it linger?<br>

<p>Oh, do you know
Where to go?<br>
Where to go?<br>
Something on your mind<br>
Wanna leave me behind<br>
Wanna leave me behind<br>

<p>You're spinning me around
My feet are off the ground<br>
I don't know where I stand<br>
Do you have to hold my hand?<br>

<p>You mystify me
You mystify me<br>
You mystify me<br>

<p>Oh, when you walk into the room
It happened all so soon<br>
I didn't want to know<br>
'Cause you really have to go<br>

<p>You mystify me
You mystify me<br>
You mystify me<br>
Oh<br>

<p>And I didn't find the words
To say I love you<br>
And I couldn't find the time<br>
To say I need you<br>

<p>It wouldn't come out right
It wouldn't come out right<br>
It just came out all wrong<br>

<p>Oh you're spinning me around
My feet are off the ground<br>
I don't know where I stand<br>
Do you have to hold my hand?<br>

<p>You mystify me
You mystify me<br>
You mystify me<br>

<p>Oh, do you know
Where to go?<br>
Where to go?<br>

<p>Oh, something on your mind
Wanna leave me behind<br>
Wanna leave me behind<br>

<p>Doo, doo-doo, doo, doo, doo-doo, doo
Doo, doo-doo, doo, doo, doo-doo, doo<br>
Doo, doo-doo, doo, doo, doo-doo, doo<br>
Doo, doo-doo, doo, doo, doo-doo, doo<br>

<p>Understand the things I say
Don't turn away from me<br>
'Cause I've spent half my life out there<br>
You wouldn't disagree<br>

<p>Do you see me?
Do you see? Do you like me?<br>
Do you like me<br>
Standing there?<br>
Do you notice<br>
Do you know? Do you see me?<br>
Do you see me?<br>
Does anyone care?<br>

<p>Unhappiness
Where's when I was young<br>
And we didn't give a damn<br>
'Cause we were raised<br>
To see life as fun<br>
And take it if we can<br>

<p>My mother
My mother, she'd hold me<br>
She'd hold me<br>
When I was out there<br>
My father<br>
My father, he liked me<br>
Oh, he liked me<br>
Does anyone care?<br>

<p>Understand what I've become
It wasn't my design<br>
And people everywhere think<br>
Something better than I am<br>

<p>But I miss you
I miss, 'cause I liked it<br>
'Cause I liked it<br>
When I was out there<br>
Do you know this?<br>
Do you know? You did not find me<br>
You did not find<br>
Does anyone care?<br>

<p>Unhappiness
where's when I was young<br>
And we didn't give a damn<br>
'Cause we were raised<br>
To see life as fun<br>
and take it if we can<br>
My mother<br>
My mother, she'd hold me<br>
She'd hold me<br>
When I was out there<br>
My father<br>
My father, he liked me<br>
Oh, he liked me<br>
Does anyone care?<br>

<p>Does anyone care?
Does anyone care?<br>
Does anyone care?<br>
Does anyone care?<br>
Does anyone care?<br>
Does anyone care?<br>

Doo, doo-doo, doo, doo, doo-doo, doo<br>
Doo, doo-doo, doo, doo, doo-doo, doo<br>
